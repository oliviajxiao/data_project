I successfully made a map of my listings. Not sure if it shows much. If I could plot the hosts' locations, that would be great, but that is only provided in the data set as strings, whereas the location of listings was in lat long, which made it easy to map. 

How do I zoom in on the map to show a specific location, so that the lat long points zoom in accordingly?
