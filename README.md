how do I add value counts together? I have value counts for international locations, and the overall number of listings.
I want to show percentage of international locations. 
    I ended up just doing this manually. 

I successfully made a map of my listings. Not sure if it shows much. If I could plot the hosts' locations, that would be great, but that is only provided in the data set as strings, whereas the location of listings was in lat long, which made it easy to map.
